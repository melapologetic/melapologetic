# hi, i'm mela.
i'm an IT student who sleeps all day but writes code every once in a while

## what do i do?
i typically write stuff in JavaScript, Python, SourcePawn, and HTML/CSS. i haven't started nor completed any full blown projects- i've only contributed to already existing code.

i also run game servers, primarily for Minecraft, [Team Fortress 2 (still a WIP)](https://bans.melapologetic.dev), and Counter-Strike 2.

## where can i contact you?
my handle is the same across most places. discord, twitter, steam, etc. all use @melapologetic.
