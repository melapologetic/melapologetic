# hi, i'm mela

i'm an IT student and soon-to-be teacher who sleeps all day but writes code every once in a while

## what do i do?

i write primarily JavaScript and HTML/CSS, with Python on the side. i haven't started nor completed any full blown projects- i've only contributed to already existing code.

i also make YouTube videos made from clips of me playing games with my friends! i don't really have an upload schedule, i just upload whenever i get around to doing it (like most things i do)

## where can i contact you?

my handle is the same across most places. my discord, twitter, steam, etc, are all the same, and they all use @melapologetic.
